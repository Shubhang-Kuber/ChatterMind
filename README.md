## ðŸ§  How It Works

ChatterMind is built on **patternâ€“response pairs** that look like this:
```python
pairs = [
    [r"hi|hello|hey", ["Hello! How can I help you today?", "Hi there! How may I assist you?"]],
    [r"my name is (.*)", ["Hello %1! How can I assist you today?"]],
    [r"tell me a joke", ["Why donâ€™t skeletons fight each other? They donâ€™t have the guts!"]],
    [r"bye|exit", ["Goodbye! Have a great day!", "See you later!"]],
]
